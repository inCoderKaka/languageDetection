# languageDetection
This is for a case when a user records his voice and expects a python program to know what language he just used. This program lets you detect whether the language spoken by the user is english or not. Stay tuned for the updates where I will add more languages that it can detect. 

To use the program all you have to do is run the program from top to bottom and at the last line specify the full path of audio file (or just spcify the name of the file if the file is in the same directory) that you want to know the language of.

For multipe files all in same folder, you need to specify the folder the files are in along with *.wav or whatever the format maybe !

Simple and easy to use. Enjoy !
